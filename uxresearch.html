    <section class=summary>
       <p>I designed and conducted this survey in 2016 to learn more about how users interact with the driver assistance features in their vehicles and to understand their preferences for how those systems communicate to the driver.  The study consisted of driver’s using three vehicles, completing a short survey after each drive and then completing a comprehensive survey following all three drives.  Each user was also filmed for review.  The findings were used to develop future use cases and proofs of concepts and were presented at the Center for Automotive Research’s Management Briefing Seminar in 2016.</p>
